# Udacity Reinforment Learning Tasks

- Temporal Difference algorithm implementation.


## Usage

The project isn't really intended for use by others, although the jupyter project files inside each task can be re-run. Rather the intent is to visualise the outcome of each of the tasks in the final jupyter files as reports.
